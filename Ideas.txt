****TO DO****
Upgrades - Need all of them, should have visual aspect to them (eventually) - scanner should be an upgrade
Scanner - Needs to have a prompt (at end of timer) saying that the coast is clear of monsters
Micro-transactions - Needs to be implemented
		   - Need the option to buy additional pet slots
Animations - Needs to be implemented, no final art - use placeholder
